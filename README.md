## Description

Creating a Portfolio Page that Showcases my Web Development Work

- My objective for working on this project was to establish a professional portfolio that highlights the projects I've created as well as my primary strengths as a web developer. I wanted to make a page where a possible employee could conduct a survey, learn more about me, look at my work, and contact me if they wanted to work with me.- I built this assignment to better understand the organization of both the HTML and CSS langauges and how they interact together to perform on a webpage. 
- Creating a professional portfolio of my work will allow a future employer to acquire a thorough grasp of my abilities as a web developer, as well as learn about my work and educational background. This portfolio will be utilized to send to places where I am applying, as well as a database of my work that I am proud of.
- This assignment taught me a range of web development abilities. I learned how to make a mobile responsive website so that users may view my website from a variety of devices. I learned how to style different areas of a website so they look different on the page. I learned how to make links to other websites or projects within images on a screen.
